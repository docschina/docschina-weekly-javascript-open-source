Kyle Simpson, the author of [YDKJS](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/74642/web), has been thinking about some pain points when using asynchronous functions, particularly in relation to being able to _cancel_ their execution when circumstances change. [The whole thread](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/74641/web) is an interesting read, complete with people making suggestions of their workarounds.

We'd be pretty keen to link to any articles or opinion pieces covering this topic if you have any spare time this weekend ;-\)
