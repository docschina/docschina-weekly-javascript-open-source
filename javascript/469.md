![](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpress/image/upload/w_280,r_140/vjyd9qtpe0t0eyl4ladt.png)The holiday season is rapidly coming to a close and we're looking forward to not only a new year but the entirety of the _Roaring Twenties_. Rest assured, the JavaScript world is not going to look the same when 2030 turns up so watch this space\! 😄

We'll be back as usual next week, but this week **we're taking a look back at 2019 and the most popular things you clicked on.** If you didn't read _every_ issue in 2019 \(we wouldn't expect you to\!\) you'll hopefully find a few things worth revisiting here.

Thanks for supporting us — we look forward to keeping you up-to-date in the years to come.

_— Peter Cooper and the Cooperpress team_

1. [The TypeScript Tax: A Cost vs Benefit Analysis](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/81862/web "medium.com") — As much as we love JavaScript, this was really a strong year for TypeScript, with it seeming to become the de facto way to bring strong typing to JavaScript.
