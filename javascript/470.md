[Snowpack: A 'Run Once' Dependency Builder/Modularizer](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/82244/web "www.snowpack.dev") — An interesting project \(formerly known as `pika/web`\) from the folks behind [Pika.](https://javascriptweekly.com/link/82245/web) The idea is that you run Snowpack once after `npm install` and it prepares your dependencies as ES _modules_ that can be loaded dynamically by the browser so you don’t need to rebundle on every code change you make. This isn’t good if you want to target old browsers, but for the 90\% of cases, this could change your dev process.
